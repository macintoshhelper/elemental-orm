# elemental-orm

**Package in early development, API may change**

TypeScript (JavaScript) compatible PostgreSQL ORM built on top of pg-promise, together with GraphQL utilities. Provides functional helper utils together with model classes that can be used to generate raw SQL or execute PostgreSQL queries.

##Â Ideas

Generate raw `*.sql` files and schema, with a GraphQL schema from model files.
